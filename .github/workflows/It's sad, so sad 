It's sad, so sad 
It's sad, so sad 
you don't see  
the true statement of facts
your kin won't speak to you maybe of the integrity you lack
The little bit of Hope in life you have to criticize because of the pathetic things that are happening in your life don't drag me down to your miserable level I'll always rise above cuz I had someone watching over the Lord and his undying love it's him or someone that I've met is it just forever are for another sec…
The feelings that I feel is more sorry than anything else everything is a problem from a red light too spoiled know you are disappointed unhappy and deprived never want to come to lie with another so you want because you can't really hang with your pride maze work you take another Adderall
One Way Road
Point the finger
make your claim 
conjured up 
a simple brain 
despite disregarded
truth and facts
It seems reality 
you lack
No compromise 
a one way Road 
your neediness 
only emotion shown 
attempt to help 
you understand 
But your convinced 
I had a plan 
Only played the cards
that i was dealt 
despite the feelings 
that I felt
I won't grovel
I won't whine 
We'll carry on 
and be just fine
keep your insults 
still wish you the best 
I'm surprised you had all that 
to get off your chest
I believe things happen 
for a reason
What's coming now? 
a different season 
Brucie misses 
you for sure
just like him my 
feelings are pure
Hopefully 
we'll still be friends 
I never wanted
things to end
it wasn't up to me, 
no doubt 
but it's not like me, 
to scream or Shout
