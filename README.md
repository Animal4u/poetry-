Poetry 
I'm tired
Aren't you tired
of living on each day?
Sick of the same shit
I'm tired of you getting your way
Forgot the monotony
I'm finished with all the squares
I wish they'd have enough
and just forget that I'm there
Is it over yet..
Not yet are you sure?
I thought we were finished
long before it's a bore...
Aren't you tired of living a lie
You aren't this great person
you pretend to be a guy.
Take off the costume
Put down the mask
Now, I can understand
why you are hiding that flask
So, that is your crutch
Do you want to know mine?
Nah, nevermind
you'll use it against me in time
I need some structure
At the same time I need none
Also at the same time
I can call myself done
