LoVe HeArTaChE, aNd TiMe

step back
and take a look
he stole your heart
because he's a crook

he's too old
and he's smokes crack
it must be
confidence you lack

he forgot your birthday
not one, but two

his jealousy is suffocating
only one unhappy is you

forget the fact, 
he doesn't treat you right
Try not to remember 
the "pill fight"

forget the fact, 
that he's a prick
or the pure existence 
of his shriveled up dick
he stole your heart 
his biggest lick

Try not to mention, 
my fat lip
Or the fact that he treats you 
like total shit

Also, that he won't 
spend a dime
while you put in all your
